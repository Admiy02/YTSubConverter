## About this tool
YouTube's built-in subtitle editor does not support styling of any kind. If you want formatting such as bold, italic and coloring, you need to upload a subtitle file instead. The site accepts a number of file formats such as RealText, WebVTT and TTML, but all of these come with their own limitations - and most importantly, none of them give access to the full array of features offered by the YouTube player. For that, you need to use a YouTube-specific format called YTT (YouTube Timed Text). It supports the following:
* Text coloring and transparency
* Background coloring and transparency (including hiding the background box completely)
* Glowing text
* Text with a drop shadow
* Bold/italic/underline
* Fonts
* Positioning (place your subtitles anywhere on the video)
* Karaoke timing (make each word of a lyric appear right as it's sung)

YTSubConverter can produce this file format for you.

## Usage
At its core, YTSubConverter is an .ass -> .ytt converter. You can create .ass subtitles using e.g. [Aegisub](http://www.aegisub.org/), which allows you to set up and preview the styling before uploading.

Conversion is straightforward: launch the program, open your .ass file and click Convert. You'll get a .ytt file that's ready for upload.

Some things to keep in mind while creating your subtitles:
* By default, Aegisub subtitles don't have a background box, meaning the resulting YouTube subtitles also won't have one. If you want a background box, open Aegisub's Style Editor and check ÅgOpaque boxÅh in the ÅgOutlineÅh section.
* A regular (non-box) outline in the .ass will result in a glow effect in the .ytt.
* A shadow in the .ass will result in a soft shadow in the .ytt. If you want to change this to a hard shadow or a glow effect, you can do so in YTSubConverter's ÅgStyle options.Åh

Apart from converting from .ass to .ytt, the tool can also convert from .sbv (the format you get when downloading subs from YouTube's built-in editor) to .srt. This allows you to download existing, unstyled subs and add styling to them. Simply open the .sbv file, click Convert, and open the resulting .srt file in Aegisub.

## ASS feature support
YTSubConverter supports the following .ass style features:
* Font name. YouTube only allows the following fonts:
  * Carrois Gothic SC
  * Comic Sans MS
  * Courier New
  * Deja Vu Sans Mono
  * Monotype Corsiva
  * Times New Roman
  * Roboto (default)
* Bold, italic, underline
* Primary, outline and shadow color
* Alignment
* Outline and shadow thickness (only checking whether the value is 0 or greater than 0)

It also supports the following override tags:
* `{\b}` - bold
* `{\i}` - italic
* `{\u}` - underline
* `{\fn}` - font. (See above for list of allowed fonts)
* `{\c}` or `{\1c}` - regular text color
* `{\2c}` - unsung karaoke text color
* `{\3c}` - outline color
* `{\4c}` - shadow color
* `{\1a}` - regular text transparency
* `{\2c}` - unsung karaoke text transparency
* `{\3a}` - background transparency
* `{\pos}` - position
* `{\k}` - karaoke segment duration
* `{\r}` - reset to current style
* `{\fad}` - simple fade
* `{\fade}` - complex fade

Unsupported tags are ignored.

## Limitations
YouTube has some bugs and limitations when it comes to styled subtitles. Please be aware of the following:
* In general, you can only use one style per line of text. For example, while you can make an entire line bold or italic, you can't do this for a single word within a line. In other words, this works: `What's happening?\N{\b1}Nononono!` (only the second line is bold) but this doesn't: `I {\b1}told{\b0} you not to go there!` (nothing will be bold).
  * As an exception to the above, multiple colors within a line *are* possible, but only on desktop. For example, the ÅgMAAANÅh in `Devil{\c&H0000FF&}MAAAN{\r}!` will be red on desktop; on mobile, however, it'll have the same color as the rest of the line.
* Subtitles positioned off-center will move out towards the sides in theater mode, possibly even hanging out of the video frame.

## Details about uploading
Styled subtitles work on your own videos, but also on those made by others: if a content creator enabled community subtitles on a video, you can upload styled subtitles for it. In both cases, it's important to immediately submit the subtitles after uploading; if you make any change in the built-in editor, all styling information will be lost.

Note that the subtitle preview in the built-in editor *does not* show the styling; it'll only become visible on the actual video once the subtitles are published/approved.

## Example workflow for creating subtitles that are color-coded by speaker
* Download the video using e.g. [youtube-dl](http://yt-dl.org). (Tip: because YT-DL picks the highest resolution by default, you can save time by using `-F` to discover the available video resolutions and then downloading with `-f <number>` to download a smaller file.)
* Open the locally saved video in a player that supports global hotkeys (e.g. VLC). If you haven't yet, set up hotkeys for pausing, resuming and rewinding the video.
* Open Notepad and type out the subtitles, using the global hotkeys to control the video without having to switch between windows.
* While typing, prefix each line with a ÅgspecialÅh character (such as `*`, `+`...) to identify the speaker. Use `\N` for manual line breaks. (Example: `*Huh, that sign has an evil rabbit on it\N+That does look evil`)
* When done, do a search/replace of each special character by the corresponding .ass color code (e.g. `*` -> `{\c&HA92EED&}`); note that the color is in the format BBGGRR, that is, in the opposite order as it would be in HTML.
* Copy the text document and paste it into Aegisub's subtitle grid.
* Set up the timings and (if needed) additional formatting.
* Save the subtitles as an .ass file.
* Convert the .ass to .ytt using YTSubConverter.
* Upload the .ytt to YouTube.
